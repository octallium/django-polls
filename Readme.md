# Django Polls (Official Docs Video Companion Series)

Code the official Django Polls application along with typing support and testing.

## Introduction

Django is one of the most widely used web framework in Python, large applications such as Instagram are still using it in production. But opposed to the popular notion, I think Django is really comprehensive and not really beginner friendly, so let's try to simplify Django and divide it into small parts as we build the official Polls app.

## Audience

1. Some basic python experience required.
2. Some familiarity with Object Oriented Programming concepts.
3. Some familiarity with SQL based databases.
4. Basic HTML/CSS.
